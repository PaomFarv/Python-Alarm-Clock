# Python-Alarm-Clock
A simple and customizable alarm clock built in Python. It allows users to set an alarm time, and once the time is reached, it plays a sound to notify the user. The project uses the pygame library to play the alarm sound and colorama to add colored terminal output for a better user experience.
